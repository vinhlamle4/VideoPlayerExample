  "description":"Similar to its predecessors, Battlefield 2042 is a multiplayer-focused first-person shooter. As the game is set in the near future, it features futuristic weapons and gadgets like deployable turrets and drones, as well as vehicles that players can commandeer.[1] Players can request a vehicle air-drop to any location.[2] The game introduced a \"Plus\" system which allows players to customize their weapons on the spot. The class system was significantly overhauled. Players can assume control of a specialist who falls under the four traditional Battlefield gameplay classes of Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. These characters can wield all the weapons and gadgets that a player has unlocked. Each operator has their own unique skills and gadgets. For instance, one of the specialists, Emma \"Sundance\" Rosier, is equipped with a wingsuit, while another, Maria Falck, is equipped with a healing pistol.[3] Levolution and destructive environments from Battlefield 4 return in Battlefield 2042, and extreme weather effects such as tornadoes and sandstorms may affect gameplay.[4] The game featured seven maps at launch.[5]",
